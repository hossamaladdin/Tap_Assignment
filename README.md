# Tap Assignment: Unified Terraform AWS RDS SQL Server

Provision SQL Server RDS on AWS with a unified, minimal Terraform setup supporting multiple environments (dev, stg, prod, and more).

## Known Issues

1. **Secrets Deletion Delay**: AWS Secrets Manager enforces a recovery window of 7â€“30 days before secrets are permanently deleted. Destroying an environment and immediately recreating it with the same secret name will fail unless you rename the secret or manually force deletion.
2. **Log Groups Not Destroyed**: CloudWatch log groups created for RDS do not get removed by `terraform destroy`. This is under investigation; manual cleanup may be required.
3. **IAM Roles Not Destroyed**: IAM roles created for RDS monitoring and EC2 secrets access may not be removed by `terraform destroy`. Manual cleanup may be required.
